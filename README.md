# qbit-night
Quantum Q Bit Night is a dedicated student initiative where we demystify the quantum realm. It's more than a club—it's a collaborative workspace where students from all disciplines come together to learn quantum computing concepts, experiment with quantum circuits, and prepare for the future of information technology.
