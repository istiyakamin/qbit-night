# Quantum Computing Glossary

A comprehensive glossary of quantum computing terms and concepts.

## A

### Amplitude
The complex number associated with each basis state in a quantum superposition. The square of the amplitude's magnitude gives the probability of measuring that state.

### Ancilla Qubit
An auxiliary qubit used in quantum computations to assist with operations but whose final state is not part of the output.

---

## B

### Bell State
One of four maximally entangled quantum states of two qubits. The most common Bell state is |Φ⁺⟩ = (|00⟩ + |11⟩)/√2.

### Bloch Sphere
A geometric representation of a single qubit state as a point on or inside a unit sphere.

### Born Rule
The rule that the probability of measuring a quantum state is equal to the square of the absolute value of its amplitude.

---

## C

### CNOT Gate (Controlled-NOT)
A two-qubit gate that flips the target qubit if the control qubit is in state |1⟩.

### Coherence
The property of a quantum system that maintains its quantum mechanical properties. Loss of coherence (decoherence) causes quantum information to be lost.

### Computational Basis
The standard basis states |0⟩ and |1⟩ for a single qubit, or their tensor products for multiple qubits.

---

## D

### Decoherence
The process by which a quantum system loses its quantum properties due to interaction with its environment.

### Density Matrix
A mathematical representation of a quantum state that can describe both pure and mixed states.

---

## E

### Entanglement
A quantum phenomenon where two or more qubits become correlated such that the state of one cannot be described independently of the others.

### Error Correction (Quantum)
Techniques to protect quantum information from errors due to decoherence and other quantum noise.

---

## F

### Fidelity
A measure of the similarity between two quantum states, ranging from 0 (orthogonal) to 1 (identical).

---

## G

### Gate (Quantum)
An operation that transforms the state of one or more qubits. Common gates include X, Y, Z, H, CNOT, and T gates.

### Grover's Algorithm
A quantum algorithm for searching an unsorted database with quadratic speedup over classical algorithms.

---

## H

### Hadamard Gate (H)
A single-qubit gate that creates an equal superposition: H|0⟩ = (|0⟩ + |1⟩)/√2.

---

## I

### Interference (Quantum)
The phenomenon where quantum amplitudes can add constructively or destructively, fundamental to quantum algorithms.

---

## M

### Measurement
The process of extracting classical information from a quantum system, which collapses the superposition to a definite state.

### Mixed State
A statistical mixture of pure quantum states, described by a density matrix with trace less than 1.

---

## N

### NISQ (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum)
The current era of quantum computing, characterized by devices with 50-1000 qubits that are too noisy for full error correction.

### No-Cloning Theorem
A fundamental result stating that it is impossible to create an exact copy of an unknown quantum state.

---

## O

### Oracle
A black-box function used in quantum algorithms like Grover's and Shor's algorithms.

---

## P

### Pauli Gates (X, Y, Z)
Single-qubit gates corresponding to rotations around the X, Y, and Z axes of the Bloch sphere.

### Phase
The argument of the complex amplitude in a quantum state, which affects interference patterns.

### Pure State
A quantum state that can be described by a single state vector (as opposed to a mixed state).

---

## Q

### Qubit
The fundamental unit of quantum information, analogous to a classical bit but capable of superposition.

### Quantum Advantage/Supremacy
The demonstration that a quantum computer can perform a computation that is infeasible for classical computers.

### Quantum Circuit
A model for quantum computation consisting of a sequence of quantum gates applied to qubits.

---

## R

### Register (Quantum)
A collection of qubits used together in a quantum computation.

### Rotation Gates (Rx, Ry, Rz)
Single-qubit gates that rotate the state around the X, Y, or Z axis by a specified angle.

---

## S

### Shor's Algorithm
A quantum algorithm for integer factorization with exponential speedup over the best known classical algorithms.

### Superposition
The ability of a quantum system to exist in multiple states simultaneously until measured.

---

## T

### T Gate (π/8 Gate)
A single-qubit gate that applies a phase of π/4, important for universal quantum computation.

### Teleportation (Quantum)
A protocol for transmitting quantum information using entanglement and classical communication.

### Tensor Product
The mathematical operation used to describe the combined state of multiple qubits.

### Tomography (Quantum)
The process of reconstructing the quantum state of a system through multiple measurements.

---

## U

### Unitary
A property of quantum gates ensuring that quantum operations are reversible and preserve probability.

### Universal Gate Set
A set of quantum gates that can approximate any quantum operation to arbitrary precision.

---

## V

### VQE (Variational Quantum Eigensolver)
A hybrid classical-quantum algorithm for finding the ground state energy of a quantum system.

---

## W

### Wave Function
A mathematical description of the quantum state of a system, typically denoted by ψ (psi).
